As part of a school project in the summer term of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the [Europa School UK](https://europaschooluk.org) [Class 3EE](https://www.europa-ee.org.uk) worked as journalists writing for a newspaper. Over 6 days in a span of two weeks, the pupils of Class 3EE explored various headline topics, interviewed distinguished people, crafted delicious recipes, reviewed the latest books, films and television programmes, created the most challenging puzzles, and described heart-stopping sports action as part of this project.

Class 3EE journalists' contributions have been put together for the very first online edition of ***The Europa Times***.
