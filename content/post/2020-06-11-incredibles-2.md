**Incredibles 2** is one of my favorite films. In it there are loads of super heroes. The main characters are **screen slaver** (the baddy), the **Incredibles** (a family of superheroes) including **Violet**, **Dash** and baby **Jack jack** (who has the most powers of all the superheroes) and **Froso** a superhero with ice powers. The most exciting part was when all fernicher fell in the water. I  would recommend it for 4-18. I give it 5 stars :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:
