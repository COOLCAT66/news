Some people think moths are not useful. They say that they just fly around and eat clothes, but that's just their opinion. In fact, moths are more useful than Bees.

Moths are active in the day and during the night, that means they can transport pollen overnight as well as the day, whilst the bees can only do this during the day. 

Dr Richard Walton found out in his study that without moths many more plant species and animals, such as birds and bats that rely on them for food, would be at risk.     

They are the future pollinator of our plants. The adults provide great food stores for Bats at night. The larvae provide all sorts of food for birds and mammals at night.  Blue tits and grey tits eat moth caterpillars. Sadly there are 28% less moths than 40 years ago, which means their numbers are getting smaller.
