A **7-month-old (10 and a half dog years) dachshund** was saved using slices of bacon.

A dog got lost in Middletown Tyas, North Yorkshire. The dog named **Floyd** got frightened because of another dog barking at him and he ran into a rapeseed field. 

A specialist dog tracker told the owners of the dog to encourage him to come back by putting food such as bacon trailing towards their house because he didnâ€™t listen if they called his name.

The owners appealed for help on Facebook. Family and friends helped in the search for the dachshund. Mandy Butler from the Lost Dog Trapping Team also came to help. They started leaving bacon, sardines and beef stock to lure him back. 

The dog returned after three days. The owners said that they wanted to get a tracking device to put on his collar.
