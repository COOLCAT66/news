The game Cluedo is a firm favourite in the Dean Household during Lockdown. **“Who dunnit”** is often a question on everyone's mind.

On Sunday 7th June 2020, the atmosphere was tense as a murder took place in Mr Black’s mansion. After a lot of questions like **“I think it was Colonel Mustard, in the conservatory with the lead pipe!”**, Daddy Dean made a guess...**WAS HE CORRECT**?

No, Daddy Dean was being an evil cheat!

He just wanted to defeat Amelie Dean, the true reigning champion, and was silly enough not to ask Amelie the most important question, **“Can you help me?”**

When he made the guess, Amelie knew his guess was wrong. The guess was wrong because Amelie had one of the cards he said was the place of the murder: **The Library**.

So lucky Amelie. The reason she won the game and kept her position of **“True reigning Champion”** was because straight after Daddy Dean’s guess she knew all the correct answers!!

The correct answers were: **Mrs Peacock, in the Study with the Revolver**.

So maybe this will teach Daddy Dean not to be a Clueless Cluedo Cheat again!
