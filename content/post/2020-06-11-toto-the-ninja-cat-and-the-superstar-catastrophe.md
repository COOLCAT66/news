This great book TOTO the ninja cat and the superstar catastrophe is by Dermot O'Leary and illustrated by  Nick East.In it TOTO fights archduke Ferdicat  a evil cat genius ! The main characters are TOTO (obviously),Silver (Toto's brother),Catface (their best friend),Jonny (a stuck-up musician) and finally socks (the new kitten on the block).Everything in it was exciting but the most interesting part was on the train in the middle of the night someone came into their cabin on the train (holding a rolling pin). I would recommend it for ages **7-18**. I give it **5 stars** :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:.
