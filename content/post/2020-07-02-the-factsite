Hi, 

**you** should check out the factsite if you want to learn some cool facts, make your essay or article have some **wow** lines or just impress your friends with your knowlage.
I reckomend the 100 facts that they did not teach you at school but there are other cool articles. Here are some mind boggling facts that I read on the factsite: the letter A appears once in 1 - 1000, oranges used to be green ( there name does not suit them then), Sony once sold 700,000 camcorders that could see through clothes!
