This is the latest novel written by **J.K. Rowling**. **The Ickabog** has been published online for free and they put out 2 chapters a day. When they publish the actual book all fundraising goes to people with **COVID-19**. It is aimed at 8-9 year-olds but a kid aged 6 has understood it so far. It is about a **dim king** being commanded by his evil friends (**Lord Spittleworth** and **Lord Flappoon**). 

**SPOILER ALERT!** 

**The Ickabog** is not real and the two lords know it but if they say the truth their careers would be over. The main characters are **King Fred the fearless**, **Lord Spittleworth** and **Lord Flappoon**. The most exciting part is so far when the whole party searching for **the Ickabog** got engulfed by fog so anything could attack. 

I give it **4.9 out of five** because you can not put it down.

## Read on for an interview with Zac Reed (the six year-old):

> **Me:** Do you like the Ickabog?    
> **Zac:** Yes, but not when someone is killed.    
> **Me:** What is good about the Ickabog?    
> **Zac:** It is like a fairy tale.    
> **Me:** Who would you recommend it for?    
> **Zac:** Four to five year-olds.    
> **Me:** Do you not feel that they would be scared?    
> **Zac:** No, I think it would be alright for them.    
> **Me:** WARNING do not listen to Zacâ€™s last answer.
