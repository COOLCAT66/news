***The Reeds are designing a Lego speeder, transporter, blaster, minifigure or robot***. There is no prize but the feeling of glory. The judge is Tristan Reed. Here are his comments: 

*There is a lack of confidence from Zac and Amanda Reed ever since Ben Reed decided to enter with an amazing cross of a blaster and speeder.* So the deadline was extended by a few days. In the end Ben Reed won. 

>*Ben Reed, how do you feel about making this blaster?   
I am honoured to receive this prestigious award.

How did you get the design?
Ummm I took pieces out of our black box and stuck them together.
 
Was there an inspiration?
Yes, tanks.*
