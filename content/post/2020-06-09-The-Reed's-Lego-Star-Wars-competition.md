***The Reeds are designing a Lego speeder, transporter, blaster, minifigure or robot***. There is no prize but the feeling of glory. The judge is Tristan Reed. Here are his comments: 

*There is a lack of confidence from Zac and Amanda Reed ever since Ben Reed decided to enter with an amazing cross of a blaster and speeder.* So the deadline was extended by a few days. In the end Ben Reed won. 

> **Me:** Ben Reed, how do you feel about making this blaster?   

> **Ben Reed:** I am honoured to receive this prestigious award.

> **Me:** How did you get the design?

> **Ben Reed:** Ummm I took pieces out of our black box and stuck them together.
 
> **Me:** Was there an inspiration?

> **Ben Reed:** Yes, tanks.*
