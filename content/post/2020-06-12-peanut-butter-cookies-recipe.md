I like this recipe because it is very easy to make, and you donâ€™t need any flour. It is a super rapid recipe! You can make it for friends who have gluten intolerance.

## Ingredients 

* 1 egg

* 200g of peanut butter

* 60g of sugar

* 2 handfuls of chocolate chips (optional)

## Method 

First put 200g of peanut butter in a bowl. 

Then crack 1 egg in a bowl, add sugar and chocolate chips then mix everything.  

Lay baking paper on a baking tray.

Make a cookie shape and decorate it with a fork by pressing on them. 

Finally bake in the oven for 10 minutes.

**Remember**

Leave a good space between each cookie To avoid them sticking together.
