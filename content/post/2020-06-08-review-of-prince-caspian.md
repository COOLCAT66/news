My book is called **“Prince Caspian”** and Mr **C.S Lewis** wrote it. Caspian lived with his Uncle Miraz and his Aunt Prunaprismia in a castle in the centre of Narnia. Miraz ruled Narnia because Caspian’s parents were dead . They were not native Narnians: they were Telmarines. Then the Pevensies appeared and put Caspian on the throne.

The main characters are: Peter, Lucy, Susan, Edmund, Trumpkin and Caspian. Peter is clever and mischievous, Susan is practical and astute, Edmund is naughty and he likes to tease, Lucy is full of imagination and she is clever, Trumpkin is nervous and clever, Caspian is brave and adventurous.

The most exciting part is when Miraz and Peter decide to do a single combat. Finally, I would recommend it to
people who like adventures. The rating is **5 stars** :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:.
