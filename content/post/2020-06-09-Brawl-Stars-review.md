The name of this video game is **Brawl Stars**. The aim of the game is to **defeat/kill** your opponents. You move your character around by moving a circle on your screen and the **more damage you do your special attack gets loaded** and it does more damage. 

The most exciting bit about this video game is that you can **brawl other players to gain or lose trophies**. You also gain **tokens** that get you **brawl boxes** that contain brawlers and more. It has a tiny bit of luck but way more skill because you need strategy. 

I recommend it for kids or teenagers that like some battling. 

The rating I give it is **5/5**.
