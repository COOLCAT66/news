**Captain Tom Moore** was a very generous man because he wanted to help people. It all started because he wanted to raise £1000 for the NHS by walking up and down his garden 100 times before his 100th birthday to thank the NHS for treatment he received for a broken hip and skin cancer. His very kind daughter’s company wrote a very short article about what her dad was doing.  Local newspapers picked up on the story and started writing about him. A bit later on BBC breakfast and he had soon raised £1 million. Soon lots of people started gathering outside to watch him do his laps. Finished challenge live on BBC on 16th April. By 20th April, he had raised £20 million. Then Nick Knowles’ DIY SOS constructed a fence around his garden to keep it safe from all the spectators. He received at least 160,000 birthday cards, so many they used the local school hall to keep them all in. He was even promoted by the army to ‘Colonel’. The Queen sent him a birthday telegram and the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, wished him a happy birthday. Even Spitfire and Hurricane planes flew over his village.
