A 7 month old **miniature dachshund** called **Floyd**, from Middleton Tyas, North Yorkshire was lost for 3 days in bad weather.

Poor Floyd got very frightened when he heard another dog barking and he ran off into a rapeseed field. His owners couldn’t see him in all the rain.
 
His owners, **Mr and Mrs Shinyshoes**, appealed for help on Facebook and other social media sources asking family and friends to join them in the search for little Floyd.

A specialist dog tracker called **Mandy Butler**, an expert from the **Lost Dog Trapping Team**, suggested Mr and Mrs Shinyshoes should try and encourage Floyd back using treats like bacon. Floyd’s owners started leaving bacon, sardines and beef stock out to lure him back home. Mandy also suggested that Floyd probably wouldn’t come back if lots of people were calling out his name.

To Mr and Mrs Shinyshoes amazement, Floyd returned home to them after 3 days. Floyd was very hungry, thirsty and tired but very happy to see his owners.

Mr and Mrs Shinyshoes really want to get a tracking device to put on Floyd’s collar, so if an unfortunate event like this happened again, they would be able to find Floyd quickly.
