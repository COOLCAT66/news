A sausage dog named Floyd who is a miniature dachshund was lost for 3 days in Middleton Tyas, North Yorkshire. Floyd is 7 months old. Meanwhile a specialist dog tracker told owners that he could be encouraged back using treats like bacon. Floyd got lost because Floyd got frightened after he heard another dog barking and ran off into a rapeseed field. Floyed returned home after 3 days.
