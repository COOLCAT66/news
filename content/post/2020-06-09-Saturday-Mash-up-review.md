This TV show is called **Saturday Mash-up**. The presenters are called **Joe Tasker** and **Harpz Kaur**. There is also a **patchwork teddy/monster** called **Stanley** as seen below in the barbers.

It is a **game show**. It has lots of games, slime and fun (eg **Musical Toilets**). The best game I think is **Musical Toilets** because instead of having chairs they have toilets and you have to dance to the music. When it stops you have to sit on one of the five toilets and they say a random number. Whoever was sitting on the toilet they called out has to **PULL THE CHAIN**. If they are lucky the top of the toilet goes green but if unlucky they get slimed! I recommend it for people who like slime and game shows and have a good sense of humour. 

I give it **4/5** out of **5/5**. 

We have an exclusive interview with **Zac Reed**, a watcher of **Saturday Mash-up**: 

> **Me:** Do you like Saturday Mash-up?    
> **Zac:** Yes, because they put TV shows in TV shows.    
> **Me:** Were you surprised that they did a lockdown series?    
> **Zac:** I was surprised when I first saw it but then I got you used to it.    
> **Me:** What has been YOUR favourite part?    
> **Zac:** Celebrity Cannonball (if you do not know what Celebrity Cannonball is it is where celebrities get asked questions about them and they get virtually shot out of a cannon).    

That is all from Zac.
