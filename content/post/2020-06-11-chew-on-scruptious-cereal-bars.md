This scrumptious snacks are the first things I baked on my own, they were very easy to make
and everyone wanted me to bake them again!

This is what you need


* 85g of butter

* 85g of brown sugar

* 3 tbsp of maple syrup

* 1/2 tsp salt

* 30 g of dried mango

* 40 g of dried apricot

This delicious snack goes really nicely with a apple or on its own!!!
