In March the UK government took the bold decision to close all schools in the country so that they didn't spread the coronavirus  and it would be safer for teachers and pupils at the school.

But because people didn't go to school pupils need to learn at home so mummys and daddys became teachers using things teachers sent them. Even if children saw their parents very often they missed their friends the most because they normally see their friends every day at school.

This is what some people think of it.

**Jack, 6years old**

*"Bit good bit bad good because we get to see are mum and dad,bad because we can't see are friends. I miss the teachers because they are kind and I miss the toys. Good about school begin shut - we get to see our family."*

**Mrs trevit,teacher of 3EE** 

*"I understand why it happened but it is very sad not to see our pupils face to face"*

*"Well I really miss being able to help my pupils by re-explaining things when they are stuck"*

*"Now I can wake up an hour later and still get to work on time as it is so close!"*"


Julia Harding, teacher and parents of 2 children, said, *"I think it is important that we shut schools to keep people safe in this crisis. I miss seeing my pupils and the people that I  work with, but it has been lovely spending more time  with my children, Cloudagh and Jack"*.

So what will happen next? In my opinion children should carry  on learning  at home until virus is over.
