**Koalas** are lazy marsupials. They live in eucalyptus forests in Australia. **Eucalyptus leaves** are all koalas eat. Eucalyptus leaves are poisonous to many other animals. <img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QApVvr6zZ-bKHZ8qZuTDiyHmPW0Evsd6cw-OkGs5RG3PuQhbiXJ1E9NZpxLvaoLAasWXWKkTiNK_tRPhFfpeirS7Zwaq2ZZE39GPaVEOY8zQCzb0s0J22iEYL6fO8RFG5S45XQ4" width="200" align="right" />


Koala babies come out of their pouches at the bottom like not many other animals.


Koalas sleep up to **22 hours a day**. They are lazier than sloths, Sloths sleep up to **9.6 hours per day**!

They move slowly to avoid wasting energy.

**Koalas beat sloths in the laziest showdown in history!**
