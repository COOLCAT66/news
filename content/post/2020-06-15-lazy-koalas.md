**Koalas** are lazy marsupials. They live in eucalyptus forests in Australia. **Eucalyptus leaves** are all koalas eat. Eucalyptus leaves are poisonous to many other animals.

Koala babies come out of their pouches at the bottom like not many other animals.


Koalas sleep up to **22 hours a day**. They are lazier than sloths, Sloths sleep up to **9.6 hours per day**!

They move slowly to avoid wasting energy.

Koalas are very clumsy on the ground, they only come to the ground in order to move to another tree.

**Koalas beat sloths in the laziest showdown in history!**
