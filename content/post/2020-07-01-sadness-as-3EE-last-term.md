Recently, class 3EE’s fun has been coming to an end. Especially when they can’t see each other.

It is the last term and we are going to have to say farewell to our teachers. But inside us we still have memories of fun stuff we did together.

The weekly banner asked one kid in 3EE about what he thought. He said, “ I think lockdown is 50/50. The pros are you get to stay at home and see lots of your parents. The cons are you don’t get to see your teachers. I miss them.

We miss them and wish COVID-19 never existed so we could see each other. But at least we can video call!

But also, in 4EE Señorita Sofia will still teach us! The teachers still send us work via our gmail and it is fun to do with our parents.
