Today I am reporting at a very strange croquet game with Cloudagh Harding, Julia Harding, Matthew Harding & Jack Harding. With chairs as hoops & golf clubs as sticks Cloudagh Harding is the first  competitor. She finds the 3rd chair tricky but she really recovered fast and she ended with 16 points! Next is Matthew Harding. He had an astonishing well controlled ball and ended with 17 points! Next is Jack Harding did really well in the first half & ended with 18 points! Finally Julia Harding, she had good confidence & ended with 19 points! but the winner is **Cloudagh Harding**! :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:
