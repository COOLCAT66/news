This is an educational website. Where you can learn languages. The more you learn the more you earn (**lingots** and **crowns**) . You can buy **power ups** and new skills to learn. It is fun not addictive fun but fun that you like it. 

I rate it **4 out of 5**.

## Read on for an interview with Tristan Reed:

> **Me:** What is good about Duolingo 

> **Tristan:** Well I have at least learnt 250 new words and completed a few quests and it is fun to find out you have completed a quest

> **Me:** Are there any bad things about duolingo

> **Tristan:** Yes sometimes when you you have missed an apostrophe or something tiny like that it says you got it wrong when you wrote the right sentence 

> **Me:** That is it from Tristan
