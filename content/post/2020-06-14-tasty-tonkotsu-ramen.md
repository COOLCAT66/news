This is a tasty hot noodle soup that makes your body warm.

Cook pork meat and bones in boiled water for 12 hours. This dish matches with dumplings. Some spring onions sliced and put on will make it better.

## Ingredients

* 2 pounds chicken backs and carcasses, skin and excess fat removed.

* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

* 1 large onion skin on roughly chopped

* 12 garlic cloves

* 1 2-inch knob ginger roughly chopped

* 2 whole leeks, washed and roughy chopped
