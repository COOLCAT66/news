In the **Atienza Miguélez** household it was all quiet. Mr Atienza and Mrs Miguélez were bathing Baby Pablo Atienza Miguélez. Julia and Martin Atienza Miguélez were writing in Julia’s room. They were writing about what they wanted to do when their parents were bathing there baby brother.

The 1st thing that they wanted to was make a bracelet out of paper for each other with there names on them. The 2nd thing that they wanted to do was make a mini necklace for their toy **llama Rosita**. The 3rd thing that they wanted to do was make some decorations for their rooms.

Martin and Julia Atienza Miguélez started to do paper balls but they wanted to do them like a sphere. Julia apparently looked around her desk and she saw a packet of tissues. She snatched a tissue and she folded it until it got to an end an then she folded it again. When they finished making the balls Julia started to make centaurs.

Then Martin needed to go to the toilet and that ended it all.
