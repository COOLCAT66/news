## What’s the main aim or point of the game - how do you play and win?

The aim of the game in Harry Potter Top Trump Match, is to match 5 cubes in a line.

There are 15 characters featured in the game for example Harry Potter, Hagrid and Hermione Granger. Your line can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.

## How to set the game up

Get the 25 cubes in the game grid ready to play.

Work with your opponent to make there sure there are no more than 1 of the same character in any horizontal, vertical or diagonal line on either side of the game grid.

Shuffle the 15 character cards and deal 2 face down to each player.

DO NOT LOOK AT THEM!!!!

Put them face down into the card spaces in front of your grid.

The youngest player starts.

## Playing the game

Player 1: push the top left corner cube out of the game grid.

Player 2: pick up the cube then use it to push out and replace any cube in the grid. 

Take it in turns to push out cubes.

Remember the aim is to get 5 of the same character in one line.

**Note**

You can not push out the cube used on the turn before.

You can put your final cube into the empty space to complete your line of 5, but you don't have to.

When you have 5 matching characters in a row, shout: **MATCH**!!!

But wait, you haven't won yet!!

The losing player turners over their 2 cards.

If either card matches the line of 5, they snach the game and win!!


## What’s the most exciting bit of the game (earning points for an avatar or making other players miss a go)?

The most exciting bit of the game is when you have a match and you are hoping that the other person hasn't got a match. You ask your opponent to show you their character card. If they haven’t got the character you’ve made with the cubes - you win. If they do have the character they win and you lose! 

## What skills do you need to be able to play this well? Or is it a game of luck?

Harry Potter Top Trump Match is a game of luck because you are hoping that the other person pushes through a cube with the character on, you are trying to make. If you have a ‘match’ you have to hope the other player doesn't have the character card for the line you made.
