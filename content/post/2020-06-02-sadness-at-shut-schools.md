ln March 2020 the Government decided that the schools should be shut down on the 21st of March because of COVID 19. The reason for this decision was the hope that, by keeping everyone at home, less people would get COVID-19. School is still happening, but only at home and teachers are sending work by **Google Classroom**, **Zoom** or **Skype**.

We wanted to know how our teachers and parents were feeling so we interviewed a few. Our teachers are feeling sad because *“they can’t see students face to face”*. Our parents are sad because we can’t see our friends. I interviewed my brother and he said that he did not want to go back to nursery because **food was better at home!!**

So what will happen next ? Well I think that schools will be shut down until December.
