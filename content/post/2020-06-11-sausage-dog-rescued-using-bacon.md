On Wednesday 6th of May, a **miniature dachshund**, called **Floyd**, got lost.
The puppy was 7 months old and he lived in Middleton Tyas, North Yorkshire.
Little Floyd was frightened , when he heard another dog barking. He ran off into a rapeseed
field.A specialist dog tracker told his owners to lure him back with treats,like
bacon. The owners asked for help on Facebook. Fortunately, all their friends
and family came to help search.

Mandy Butler, from the lost dog trapping team, came to help, but she said, &quot;Floyd
wouldn&#39;t come if people were calling his name,&quot; so they started leaving bacon,
sardines and beef stock out to lure him back.Little Floyd returned after 3 days. Now his
owners want to get a tracking device for his collar.
