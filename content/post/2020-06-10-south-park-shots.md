On May 23, Ayman, Sam and Emile saw each other at South Park. They noticed that someone had put new graffiti all over their football aiming spot so they created a new one called KA (Kipsta related Aiming) where there are the following targets:


**Top corners** = 1000 points

**Middle** = 100 points

**Bottom corners** = 500 points

They took shots in this order:

Emile

Ayman

Sam

After a few rounds, Sam decided to leave because Ayman and Emile were not focusing and instead crossing the ball across the pitch then volleying it.

Ayman said, *“It was close, Emile took his last shot and then it was My turn. I was under so much pressure!”* He took a deep breath, he aimed. **Boom!** All eyes on the ball, he had got it in the bottom right corner! **He had won!**

The winner said, *“It was really close but I got it in and I finished about 400 points in the lead ahead of Emile.”*
