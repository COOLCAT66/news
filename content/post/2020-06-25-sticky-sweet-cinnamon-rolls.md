If you are a big fan of cinnamon, you will love these. **THEY ARE THE BEST!**

**Tips:** If the dough is too sticky, you may need to add a little extra flour to remove it from the bowl. Also make sure you use plenty of flour when rolling the dough out. When putting the cinnamon paste on make sure when you are finished it looks like a pizza.

To enjoy these the most, they can be warmed in the microwave.


## Ingredients

365g all-purpose flour

42g granulated sugar

1 teaspoon salt

1 package instant yeast 1 packet = 2 and 1/4 teaspoons

120ml water

60ml milk

28g unsalted butter

1 large egg


### For The Filling:

96g unsalted butter, softened to room temperature

2 tablespoons ground cinnamon

40g brown sugar

### For The Glaze:

100g powdered sugar

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

2-3 tablespoons milk


## Method
 
### To Make dough:

In a large bowl, mix the flour, the sugar, salt, and yeast together until evenly dispersed. Set aside. 

In a small microwavable bowl, heat the water, milk, and butter together in the microwave until the butter is melted (about 30-45 seconds).

Stir the butter mixture into the flour mixture.

Add the egg and knead with hand or with a stand mixer for 3-4 minutes or until the dough is no longer sticky.

Place in a lightly greased bowl and let rest for about 5 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees and turn off after 10 minutes or just before placing rolls in the oven.

### To Make Filling:

After the dough has rested for 5 minutes, roll it out in a 15x9 inch rectangle. Spread the softened butter on top.

Mix together the cinnamon and sugar and sprinkle it all over the dough.

Roll up the dough tightly and cut into 9 (large) pieces.

Place in a lightly greased 9-inch or square pan (or cut into 12 small pieces and place in a 9x13 pan) and lightly cover with aluminum foil or plastic wrap.

TURN OFF the oven and place the cinnamon buns in the oven to rise for 20 minutes.

Keep the buns in the oven (REMOVE THE FOIL OR PLASTIC) and turn on the oven to 190 Fan.

Bake the cinnamon rolls for 15-20 minutes or until golden. Remove from the oven and top with glaze.

### To make glaze:

Mix the powdered sugar, vanilla and 2 tablespoons milk together until smooth and lump free. 

Drizzle over warm rolls.
