This is my article for *English Class*. I wrote it because it is part of the school work that Mrs Trevitt, my English teacher, assigned for my class to do. After writing this article, I will submit it through **Google Classroom**. If I like, I can also share this article to Mrs Trevitt and the rest of my classmates on a shared **Google Drive** folder. 


> I like writing articles like this. I think it is a lot of fun.
