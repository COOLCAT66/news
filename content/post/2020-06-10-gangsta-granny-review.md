This a review is of Gangster Granny by David Walliams. The book talks about a boy called Ben who ran away from his dancing competition to his normal and boring granny who likes cabbage. Until one day Ben discovered that his boring granny was an international jewel thief which was the most exiting bit for me.

The main characters of the book are Ben and Granny. Granny’s character was
presented in my opinion as a bad person and sneaky, but you might think that she
is amazing and brave. Ben was presented as a good person.

I think children aged **8-10 years old** would enjoy this book. I would give it **5 stars**.

The part that I didn’t like was when granny got cancer and died because it can make a sensitive child very sad.
