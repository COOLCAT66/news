This is an event where contestants may compete. There is no prize except the feeling of victory. It was held on the second of June. Contestants may choose to act a performance whilst bouncing or do the high jump or both. In first place there was Tristan Reed for both categories Zac Reed in second and Amanda Reed in third, Ben Reed did not compete because he ‘was working’. We have an exclusive interview with Zac Reed who came second place: 

> **Me:** How do you feel about coming in second place?    
> **Zac:** I feel ok.    
> **Me:** Do you feel your act should have come in first place?    
> **Zac:** No but I would have liked to come in first place but I did not. 

That is all from Zac.
